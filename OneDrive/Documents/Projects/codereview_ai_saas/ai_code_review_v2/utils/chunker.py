File chunker — splits large source files into manageable chunks
before sending to Gemini, then merges the results back.

Strategy:
  • Files ≤ CHUNK_SIZE  → sent as-is (1 Gemini call)
  • Files  > CHUNK_SIZE → split at function/class boundaries when
                          possible, otherwise at line boundaries
